# Quantum-approximate-optimisation-algorithms-for-real-world-scenarios---Strangeworks

## Introduction

Several of the topics that are currently emerging have problems due to the amount of computational resources that are required, from studying new DNA behaviors, to organizing sporting events or analyzing structures with new materials. All these cases have required a tremendous computational power, which classical computing has not been able to solve completely, due to the fact that the cost grows exponentially with the number of parameters that the problem has.
Therefore, one of the options to solve this problem is the Quantum approximate optimisation algorithms (QAOA). This method is reliable but has the detail that the time in Quantum Hardware is expensive, so the idea of the project is to find a way to reduce slightly the costs of this method and hope that in the future it will be smaller and more optimal than the classical models.   


## Solution

The component of the problem proposed by Strangeworks is to approach the maximum cut problem from a graph representation of the project. This problem mainly suggests working with 4 binary nodes. Using this representation, we start with the QAOA process of finding the minimum energy of the Hamiltonian. With this in mind, We would like to know the cost of doing it with the QOAO. 

The steps: 
* Define the Graph with the weights
* Obtain the Hamiltonian from the graph
