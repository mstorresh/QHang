## Introduction

Several of the topics that are currently emerging have problems due to the amount of computational resources that are required, from studying new DNA behaviors, to organizing sporting events or analyzing structures with new materials. All these cases have required a tremendous computational power, which classical computing has not been able to solve completely, due to the fact that the cost grows exponentially with the number of parameters that the problem has.
